# Breakout

A modern reimplementation of the classic Breakout arcade game, built from scratch using C++ and OpenGL. This project focuses not only on gameplay mechanics but also on enhancing the visual experience with particles, text rendering, and post-processing effects â€” making it a fun and visually rich tribute to the original game.

Gameplay Features

Classic Breakout Mechanics: Control a horizontal paddle to bounce a ball and break all bricks before the ball touches the bottom of the screen.

Dynamic Ball Physics: Ball reflects off the paddle, bricks, and walls with direction based on hit location.

Brick Destruction: Bricks are removed upon collision; player wins when all bricks are destroyed.

Game Over Logic: Ball reaching the bottom edge results in losing a life or game over.

Enhanced Visual Features

Particle Effects: Bricks and collisions generate dynamic particle explosions.

Power-Ups: Extend paddle, slow motion, multi-ball, and more.

Multiple Custom Levels: Easily extendable and customizable level layouts.

Text Rendering: Score and lives displayed on-screen using bitmap font rendering.

Post-Processing Effects: Glow, shake, blur, and color distortion for added impact and polish.
